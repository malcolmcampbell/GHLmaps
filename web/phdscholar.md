# Scholarships and Internships.

The GeoHealth Laboratory normally supports a small number of competitively awarded PhD, Masters and Internship students. 
The projects are focused on topics in GeoHealth and usually are closely related to the needs of the health sector. 
For more information on potential projects contact Prof Malcolm Campbell (Malcolm.Campbell@Canterbury.ac.nz) or Prof. Simon Kingham (simon.kingham@canterbury.ac.nz) after reading the information on this page in full.

## UC Doctoral Scholarships.

Amount $32,000 per annum (2025) and tuition fees at the domestic rate. Tenure 3 years. See the link on the UC website [UC doctoral announcement](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/getting-started/scholarships/doctoral-scholarships).
The next UC Doctoral Scholarship round will open in August and close in October 2025 for those starting their studies in 2026. 
More information below. UC Connect Doctoral Scholarship - These scholarships are co-funded by UC and external agencies to support students for study towards a research doctoral degree at the University. 
The scholarships are available to support work on specific funded projects only.

## Masters Scholarships.

Get in touch if you are interested in undertaking a GeoHealth masters project. We often have scholarships available. Send a 1-page outline of a proposed GeoHealth project to one of the Directors. This could be as part of a MURR, MGDS, MDRR or MSc/MA in Geography among other subjects or degrees.

## Internships.

We often have projects are closely related to the GeoHealth interests and students have opportunities for collaboration with the wider GeoHealth Lab team. These internships normally occur over the summer period (Nov-Feb in NZ).

## Postgraduate study – further information.

Before you send an email, please familiarise yourself with our work. 
We try to maintain a comprehensive website with a variety of information (e.g. publications, open data, etc). 
Have a look at our work and research agenda and decide whether it is matched with your interests. 
Please note, we receive multiple emails from prospective postgraduate students and are unable to respond to generic applications. 
At minimum, we expect prospective candidates to understand what we do and how we do it by reading about our work and the methods we employ.
For a Ph.D., candidates must have completed, or be completing, an appropriate qualifying degree or other qualifications at a level judged to be equivalent to a bachelor’s degree with first-class honours or master’s degree with distinction at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury. 
The GPA from their last two years of relevant academic study must be equivalent to a UC GPA of at least 7.0. (In other words, an “A” grade minimum)

## What are we looking for?

In general terms, here are some hints and suggestions:
•	Fit within our group – usually evidenced by complementary research interests and methods, or evidence of publication(s) that match our research foci.
•	Visibility in scholarly communication – for example, a website with up-to-date information about your work and research.
•	Where relevant, evidence of GIS and/or coding expertise – for example, use of R and spatial packages.
•	Quality of your written English and communication skills.
•	As a developing independent scholar – the ability to demonstrate self-motivation, and proactivity in your research.

## What should I do next?

When sending us an email about a potential PhD, you will need to prepare your CV. Alongside highlighting relevant skills and methods to undertake an advanced research project, you should also write the following.
•	Short research proposal that contains a summary of the topics that you find interesting and a short literature review (supported by relevant references) that covers recent developments in your area of interest, and an idea and plan for your PhD research. We suggest between 2 and 4 pages. 
•	You should be able to articulate relevant research gaps and what your contribution to them may be if you came to study with us.
•	Examples of your writing (e.g. a thesis or individual assignment - not group assignments, or a recent publication);
•	A short summary of one of our recent articles with your thoughts on how you would use the article(s) for your research and how you might extend the work.
•	How you might fit into a wider research team. Think about links to GHL, GRI and the wider disciplines of Geography and Health at UC.
•	Why New Zealand? Outline the rationale for choosing the GHL at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch.

## Important note - Funding.

Securing appropriate funding is a very important aspect of doing a PhD and a common obstacle that needs to be considered as early as possible, normally pre-application. 
If there is no clear pathway for funding, it is unlikely you will succeed in your studies. 
While obtaining scholarships for PhD is usually challenging and highly competitive, securing funding is not impossible. 

Please write clearly and concisely. Thanks again for your interest! 
**Good Luck.**
